# Flask Docker Container

This guide provides instructions for creating a Flask Docker container. Docker allows you to package your Flask application with all its dependencies into a single, portable unit, ensuring consistent and reproducible deployment across different environments.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Docker: Visit the official [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
- Flask: If you haven't already, install Flask on your local machine. You can use `pip` to install Flask by running `pip install flask` in your terminal.

## Steps

Follow these steps to create a Flask Docker container:

1. **Create a Flask Application**: Start by creating a Flask application. You can organize your Flask app code in a directory structure that suits your needs.

2. **Create a `Dockerfile`**: In the root directory of your Flask application, create a file named `Dockerfile` (without any file extension). This file will contain instructions for building the Docker image.

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use the official Python base image
   FROM python:3.9
   
   # Set the working directory inside the container
   WORKDIR /app
   
   # Copy the requirements file
   COPY requirements.txt .
   
   # Install the Python dependencies
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
   
   # Copy the rest of the application code
   COPY . .
   
   # Set the entry point of the container
   ENTRYPOINT ["python"]
   
   # Set the command to run the Flask application
   CMD ["app.py"]
   ```

   Make sure to adjust the `FROM` line if you require a different Python version.

3. **Create a `requirements.txt` file**: In the same directory as the `Dockerfile`, create a file named `requirements.txt`. This file should contain the list of Python dependencies required by your Flask application. Each dependency should be listed on a separate line.

   Example `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   Flask==2.0.1
   ```

   Make sure to include all the necessary dependencies for your application.

4. **Build the Docker Image**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt` files. Run the following command to build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t flask-app .
   ```

   This command tells Docker to build an image using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory and name the image `flask-app` (you can change the name as desired). The `.` at the end of the command specifies that the build context is the current directory.

5. **Run the Docker Container**: After the image has been built successfully, you can run the Docker container using the following command:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app
   ```

   This command maps port 5000 of the container to port 5000 of the host system. Adjust the port mapping as necessary based on your Flask application's configuration.

6. **Access Your Flask Application**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access your Flask application running inside the Docker container.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a Flask Docker container. You can now distribute and deploy this container to different environments with ease.
